\chapter{Conclusions}

I conclude that my project is awesome.  Hey look at this table.
\begin{table}[htb]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|ccc|r|}
	\hline
$k$ &  $x_1^k$    &   $x_2^k$  & $x_3^k$   & remarks  \\
	\hline
0   & -0.3 & 0.6 & 0.7  &  \\
1   & 0.47102965 & 0.04883157 & -0.53345964  & *\\
2   & 0.49988691 & 0.00228830 & -0.52246185 & $s_3$ \\
3   & 0.49999976 & 0.00005380 & -0.52365600  & \\
4   & 0.5 & 0.00000307 & -0.52359743  & $\epsilon < 10^{-5}$ \\
7   & 0.5 & 0 & -0.52359878  & $\epsilon < \xi $ \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{This is a great table.}
\label{greatTable}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Isn't Table~\ref{greatTable} really nice?  This next one is nice too.

\begin{table}[htb]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l||l|l||l|l|}
\hline
 &\multicolumn{2}{l|}{Singular}&\multicolumn{2}{l|}{Plural}\\
\cline{2-5}
 &English&\textbf{Gaeilge}&English&\textbf{Gaeilge}\\
\hline\hline
1st Person&at me&\textbf{agam}&at us&\textbf{againn}\\
2nd Person&at you&\textbf{agat}&at you&\textbf{agaibh}\\
3rd Person&at him&\textbf{aige}&at them&\textbf{acu}\\
 &at her&\textbf{aici}& & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Another nice table.}
\end{center}
\end{table}
