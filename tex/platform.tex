\todo {Describe the components that were extracted (i.e. what the extracted libraries do, what additional functionality we've added), and link to the sections discussing their design. There should be one section per component, plus an overview section showing the package diagram of the sections are related. The last section will discuss unit testing, and the use of the case studies as integration testing to ensure that new package versions continue working with each other}.
