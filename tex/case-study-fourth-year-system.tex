\section {Overview}

The fourth-year project management system is used by the department of Systems and Computer Engineering at Carleton University to manage the completion of fourth-year projects by students in software- and systems-related programs. The system is provides students with information on candidate projects, expectations, deadlines and deliverables, and also manages the submission of some project deliverables. The system is used by
\begin{itemize}
\item the \keyword{Project Coordinator}, who is an instructor responsible for overall administration of the fourth-year projects and events;
\item \keyword{Project Supervisors}, which are instructors who suggest candidate projects and supervise the completion of individual projects; and
\item \keyword{Project Group Members}, which are students who must be members of exactly one project group.
\end{itemize}

The system fulfills its functional requirements, but requires significant effort on the part of students to navigate, as all actions, information and deadlines are available at all times. It offers a good example of a system where the user experience could be improved by structuring the system into workflows. Additionally, the system involves deadlines and collaborative activities between multiple actors, which makes it a good test of the capabilities of the Stonepath workflow framework.

\sectionnote {BM}
\section {Requirements}
The required functionality of the fourth-year project management system can be split into three main concerns:
\begin{itemize}
\item \keyword{account management}, which involves creating accounts for Project Supervisors and Project Group Members, as well as authentication with the system;
\item \keyword{project selection}, which entails Project Supervisors creating candidate projects and managing group membership, as well as Project Group Members browsing available projects, consulting with Project Supervisors to find a project, and joining a project; and
\item \keyword{project execution}, which involves all of the collaboration between Project Group Members and the Project Supervisor(s) for their project.
\end{itemize}

Individual use cases for these concerns are illustrated in Figures \ref{fig:case-4ys-use-case-account-management} through \ref{fig:case-4ys-use-case-oral-reports}. Note that the project execution concern has been split into its own use case diagram (Figure \ref{fig:case-4ys-use-case-oral-reports}) as its requirements are somewhat more complex than the other phases of the project lifecycle.

\subsection{Project Execution}
\label{sec:4ys-project-execution}

Though all three concerns are important to the system, the most interesting from the point of view of a workflow framework is the project execution phase. This phase accounts for the majority of the lifetime of a fourth-year project, and is also the area in the existing fourth year project management system that could use the most improvement. While account creation and project selection mostly involve basic CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) actions, the execution phase has a well-defined flow:
\begin{enumerate}
\item First, a project proposal must be drafted, submitted, revised, and accepted.
\item After the proposal is accepted, an oral presentation scheduling form must be filled out.
\item Concurrently with scheduling an oral presentation, a progress report must be prepared and submitted.
\item After the progress report is accepted, an oral presentation must be given.
\item After the oral presentation, the group must prepare a presentation for the poster fair. Though this activity has no online deliverables, the group may opt to fill out a poster fair demo request form.
\item While the group is preparing for the poster fair, a final report must also be drafted, submitted, revised, and accepted.
\end{enumerate}
Additionally, each step of the fourth-year project process has associated deadlines.

Use case descriptions for the project execution phase are provided in Tables \ref{tbl:use-case-produce-proposal} through \ref{tbl:use-case-final-report}.

\section{Workflow Design}
\label{sec:4ys-workflow-design}

With the addition of a ``select  project'' step to account for the project being created and selected in the selection phase, the six-step project execution phase described in section \ref{sec:4ys-project-execution} is the core workflow of a project in the fourth-year project management system. As this high-level workflow is completely linear, it can be trivially transformed into the state chart in Figure \ref{fig:state-machine-project-lifecycle}. In this model, the project is a Stonepath work item, while each step is associated with a set of tasks (ex. producing a proposal or submitting a poster fair demo form), which can be extracted from the use case descriptions in section \ref{sec:4ys-project-execution}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering \includegraphics[width=3.8in]{./img/case-study-fourth-year-system/project_lifecycle}
\caption{State chart representation of the workflow for an overall project lifecycle from creation to completion.}
\label{fig:state-machine-project-lifecycle}
\end{figure}

In fact, the majority of the tasks described by the use cases involve the Project Group Members submitting an artifact, the Project Supervisor reviewing it, and then either returning it or accepting it. These tasks can be modelled as Stonepath tasks, which may be assigned to Project Group Members and Project Supervisors. This process is captured in Figure \ref{fig:state-machine-document-submission}. This model leverages Stonepathâ€™s state-based model of tasks to handle multiple activities in parallel (ex. filling out the oral report scheduling form, and producing a progress report.)

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering \includegraphics[width=3.0in]{./img/case-study-fourth-year-system/document_submission}
\caption{State chart representation of a general document submission task, such as proposal submission.}
\label{fig:state-machine-document-submission}
\end{figure}

Other tasks to produce deliverables require only some small modifications to the state chart in Figure \ref{fig:state-machine-document-submission}. For instance, the special handling of deadlines for final reports can easily be handled with two extra state transitions, as Figure \ref{fig:state-machine-final-report-submission} demonstrates.

Similarly, the consensus requirement to submit the oral presentation scheduling form only requires a guard clause. On the other hand, it does not make sense to ``return'' a scheduling form if a participant has a conflict; instead, the participant only needs to edit the form and ask the others to approve it again. This workflow is demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:state-machine-oral-presentation-scheduling}.

\section{Design}
\label{sec:4ys-design}

The design of the system was performed in a top-down fashion, starting from the core project workflow depicted in Figure \ref{fig:state-machine-project-lifecycle}. The system must accommodate multiple concurrent tasks for a user: not only can some states involve multiple tasks, but Project Supervisors may be involved with several project simultaneously. The clearest way to present all of the concurrent tasks for a user is in a tabular view, as depicted in the wireframe in Figure \ref{fig:wireframe-tasks-view}. The user can then select a task from their pending tasks, and carry out the actions associated with its present state.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering \includegraphics[width=6in]{./img/case-study-fourth-year-system/supervisor-tasks-view_wireframe}
\caption{Wireframe of the tasks view for a Project Supervisor. The tasks view presents the tasks generated by the project state machine in Figure \ref{fig:state-machine-project-lifecycle}. ``Lorem ipsum'' placeholder text has been used in place of introductory and explanatory text.}
\label{fig:wireframe-tasks-view}
\end{figure}

In order to achieve this requirement, the system needs to treat different types of tasks in a project generically - a naive implementation that places each type of task (such as a proposal or progress report) in a discrete ActiveRecord model makes it complex to find all of the outstanding tasks for a user. Stonepath has a SPTask mixin that allows a task to be associated with a workbench (ex. a Project Supervisor) and a workitem (a project). A model extending SPTask might be associated with each task for each workbench / workitem pair, using a polymorphic association. Unfortunately this model is very complex to implement and query, as demonstrated by Figure \ref{fig:sptask-complexity}. Though the relationship between users and tasks is now generic, a polymorphic many-to-many relationship like \verb!Task! is difficult to traverse, as discussed in section \ref{sec:stonepath-prototyping-results}. Additionally, this data model is unnecessarily complex to update in exceptional cases: if a Project Supervisor or Project Group Member needs to be added or removed from the project, then new \verb!Task!s must be added or removed from the database through some means other than the projectâ€™s state machine.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering \includegraphics{./img/case-study-fourth-year-system/task-with-sptask-static-structure}
\caption{Logical class diagram of the relationship between concrete tasks of the project workflow (such as proposals and progress reports), projects, supervisors, and group members using Stonepath concepts.}
\label{fig:sptask-complexity}
\end{figure}

Instead of making use of the Stonepath task model, a simpler custom data model was designed instead. As pictured in Figure \ref{fig:custom-task-simplicity}, instances of a new generic \verb!Task! type are associated directly with a project. This is conceptually much simpler, and also allows Project Supervisors and project Group Members to be added and removed from projects without altering the tasks associated with the project.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering \includegraphics{./img/case-study-fourth-year-system/task-through-project-static-structure}
\caption{Logical class diagram of the relationship between concrete tasks of the project workflow (such as proposals and progress reports), projects, supervisors, and group members using a custom task model.}
\label{fig:custom-task-simplicity}
\end{figure}

With the framework in place to access individual tasks, it was decided that each task in a project would have its own page. In general, task pages are laid out with a detailed task description, followed a short summary of the state of the task, actions that can be performed on the task, and then any other data that is necessary to complete the activity corresponding to the current state of the task. This centralizes information related to a task, and guides the user through the process of completing it. The wireframes in Figures \ref{fig:wireframe-group-member-proposal-view} and \ref{fig:wireframe-supervisor-proposal-view} demonstrate this layout with a proposal task: first, there is a description of the proposal requirements (the task description), followed by a summary of the task state (the file associated with the current submission), actions (``submit'', and ``return'' or ``accept''), and auxiliary data (the submission history.) Note that the actions displayed for the proposal are selected based on the current user's role and the state of the task.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering \includegraphics[width=6in]{./img/case-study-fourth-year-system/group-member-proposal-view_wireframe}
\caption{Wireframe of the proposal view of for a Project Group Member when the proposal is in the ``writing submission'' or ``reviewing'' states. The member may upload a new submission with a comment.}
\label{fig:wireframe-group-member-proposal-view}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering \includegraphics[width=6in]{./img/case-study-fourth-year-system/supervisor-proposal-view_wireframe}
\caption{Wireframe of the proposal view of for a Project Supervisor when the proposal is in the ``reviewing'' state. The supervisor may either return the proposal with a comment, or accept it with a comment.}
\label{fig:wireframe-supervisor-proposal-view}
\end{figure}

Another important feature of the system is user authentication and managing user profile data. From examining the requirements in section \ref{sec:account-management}, it is clear that Project Group Members, Project Supervisors, and Project Coordinators have many profile attributes in common. These attributes are captured in Table \ref{tbl:user-profile-attributes}.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \caption{User profile attributes used by each role in the system. Note that the attributes for a Group Member are a strict superset of those used by every other role.}
  \label{tbl:user-profile-attributes}
  \tablespacer
  \begin{tabular}{ l l }
    \toprule
    Attribute & Roles \\
    \midrule
    Full name & All \\
    Email & All \\
    Encrypted Password & All \\
    Programme & Project Group Member \\
    Student Number & Project Group Member \\
    Project & Project Group Member \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

There are a few ways to model the users, roles, and attributes in the system. One possibility is to represent each role as its own class; however, as Project Coordinators also act as Project Supervisors, this would lead to a confusing ER model, as both classes would need to be related to Tasks and Projects. Additionally, Project Coordinators and Project Supervisors have identical attributes, so this approach would lead to needlessly duplicated code.

A more refined approach would be to model Project Coordinators and Project Supervisors as the same class, with an attribute to discriminate them. This would enable code reuse for the two roles, and would let Project Supervisors become Project Coordinators (and vice versa) without having to delete and recreate their accounts. It would also produce an expressive ER model - Project Coordinators and Project Supervisors could be referenced through the same foreign key, while Project Group Members could not be accidentally associated. Unfortunately, most Account Management use cases in section \ref{sec:account-management} apply to all roles in the system, so separating the role types into distinct classes remains an impediment to code reuse.

The final approach is to combine all of the roles into a single class, and discriminate them based on a role attribute. While this has the disadvantage of producing a less expressive ER model which canâ€™t distinguish references to Supervisors from references to Group Members, it was selected for implementation as it permits significant code reuse for authentication and profile management. Rails has ORM facilities available to ensure that invalid relationships are not saved to the database, which are discussed further in section \ref{sec:4ys-implementation}.

Given a single class to represent a userâ€™s profile, there are two options to represent the userâ€™s role. It could be represented as either a single-valued attribute for simplicity, or a multi-valued attribute to capture the fact that userâ€™s can have multiple effective roles (eg. a Project Coordinator may also fill the role of a Project Supervisor.) However, as only Project Coordinators fill multiple roles, and it is unlikely that the system will develop a need to more granular roles, the decision was made to represent roles as single values and let the implementation handle determining which effective roles a user may fulfill.

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:4ys-implementation}

\todo{Add an introduction to this section and present it in a logical order.}

\sectionnote{BM}
\subsection{Task Assignment}
The data model in Figure \ref{fig:custom-task-simplicity} was realized as the ER model represented in Figure \ref{fig:custom-task-er-model} using multiple-table inheritance (MTI.) Though there are Rails libraries available that implement MTI, such as acts\_as\_relation and heritage (\todo{cite}), neither are documented to work with Rails 4 and both mask the fact that MTI subclasses are not substitutable. Instead of using a library, MTI was implemented manually using Railsâ€™ polymorphic associations. The base Task table contains all of the data required to present it in a task list (such as a summary of the task and when it is due), as well as the attributes for a polymorphic ActiveRecord association with the various task types. This permits a single query over the task table to select the summaries of all tasks assigned to a user, while each task page (such as the proposal task page in Figure \ref{fig:wireframe-group-member-proposal-view}) can retrieve the specialized task instance it requires and display it.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering \includegraphics{./img/case-study-fourth-year-system/task-through-project-er-model}
\caption{ER diagram depicting how the logical class model in Figure \ref{fig:custom-task-simplicity} translates to a relational model for the Rails Object Relational Mapper (ORM).}
\label{fig:custom-task-er-model}
\end{figure}

Though the mapping from the ER model in Figure \ref{fig:custom-task-er-model} to Rails migrations is trivial, cleanly implementing the multiple table inheritance structure in Rails is less straightforward. Models representing specific tasks need to do three things:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item indicate their relationship with the generic task type using a \verb!has_one! association;
  \item delegate accessors for the generic taskâ€™s attributes through the association;
  \item and provide a way to create a generic task and a specific task at the same time.
\end{enumerate}

These responsibilities were extracted into a mixin named \verb!Taskable!, presented in Figure \ref{fig:taskable-mixin-definition}. As demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:taskable-mixin-example}, models representing specific tasks only need to include Taskable in order to act as specific tasks. These tasks can be created using the conventional ActiveRecord API, eg. \\ \verb!Proposal.create(project: p, deadline: DateTime.now + 10.days)!.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \begin{lstlisting}
module Taskable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern
  included do
    has_one :task, as: :taskable
    extend Forwardable
    def_delegators :task, :project, :deadline, :completed_at
  end

  module ClassMethods
    def create(**options)
      # ... helper method to handle creating generic tasks and
      # specific taskables with one method call ...
    end
  end
end
  \end{lstlisting}

\end{figure}


\sectionnote{BM}
\subsection{Workflow Generalization}

The task completion workflows presented in \ref{sec:4ys-workflow-design} can be thought of as specializations of a basic submission workflow; if the core process of submitting a document changes, it is likely to impact all tasks. It would be nice to reuse the definition of the core submission workflow among all of the tasks that extend it. This way, changes to the core submission process only need to be made in one place, and it is clear how two tasks that specialize the core workflow differ.

While this is somewhat awkward to express in class-based state machines, it is easy to implement in Rails with AASM. AASM permits multiple \verb!aasm do ... end!
blocks in the body of a model definition. Each block can add new states or events, or refine behaviours associated with previously-defined states and events. Thus, the common states and transitions shared by all tasks implementing extensions of a common workflow may be captured in one such
\verb!aasm! block, while extensions are implemented in successive blocks.

Using this feature, the most general submission workflow was implemented as the \verb!DocumentSubmissionWorkflow! concern given in Figure
\ref{fig:document-submission-concern}. Task implementations that do not require any modification of the base workflow (such as proposal submission) can simply \verb!include DocumentSubmissionWorkflow!. Other tasks requiring a refined submission workflow may include the concern, and follow it with additional \verb!aasm! blocks. The implementation of the \verb!FinalReport! task given in Figure \ref{fig:final-report-workflow-specialization} exemplifies this approach.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \begin{lstlisting}
module DocumentSubmissionWorkflow
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    include AASM

    aasm do
      state :writing_submission, initial: true
      state :reviewing, enter: :notify_submitted
      state :accepted,
            after_enter: [:notify_accepted, :record_submission]

      event :submit do
        transitions from: [:writing_submission, :reviewing],
                    to: :reviewing
      end

      event :return do
        transitions from: :reviewing, to: :writing_submission,
                    on_transition: :notify_returned
      end

      event :accept do
        transitions from: :reviewing, to: :accepted
      end
    end
  end
end

\subsection{User Profiles and Authentication}

As well, the subsystem for authentication and user profiles described in section \ref{sec:4ys-design} was implemented. Devise was used to implement authentication for a \verb!User! model, with the attributes detailed in Table \ref{tbl:user-profile-attributes}. The validations prescribed in Tables \ref{tbl:use-case-create-account} through \ref{tbl:use-case-authenticate} were implemented, along with additional validations to ensure that the attributes which apply only to Project Group Members could not be accidentally added to users in other roles. These in-application validations provide the equivalent data integrity guarantees as splitting the User model into distinct models by role type. A code snippet with an example of these validations appears in Figure \ref{fig:4ys-user-validations}. Note the use of the \verb!is_group_member?! predicate: as alluded to in section \ref{sec:4ys-design}, the implementation of the User model provides appropriate predicates (named \verb!is_group_member?!, \verb!is_supervisor?!, and \verb!is_coodinator?!) to describe which effective roles are indicated by the value of a \verb!User!â€™s role attribute.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \begin{lstlisting}
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  # ...
  with_options unless: :is_group_member? do |m|
    m.validates :programme, absence: true
    m.validates :student_number, absence: true
    m.validates :project_id, absence: true
  end
  # ...
end
  \end{lstlisting}
  \caption{Code snippet illustrating the use of the conditional validations to ensure that extra attributes are only set for users with the Project Group Member role.}

\end{figure}

\sectionnote{BM}
\subsection{Authorization}

\todo {Cite documentation in the following paragraphs}

With authentication and user profiles in place, authorization was the next requirement. Many actions, such as creating projects, can only be performed by users in specific roles. While access checks could be implemented manually using if-else statements and query filters in the controllers and views, this would lead to code duplication: permission checks could end up duplicated in multiple controllers, and the views linking to those controllers would also have to include the checks to prevent inaccessible links from being displayed. Fortunately, Rails has several authorization libraries available which provide conventions to centralize, enforce, and query permission checks. We considered Stonewall, Cancan, Authority, and Pundit for the access control system. These libraries are described briefly below.

\paragraph{Stonewall.} The developers of Stonepath also produced Stonewall, which is intended to be an access-control library that integrates well with Stonepath. Stonewall defines permissions at the model level using a complex DSL, and applies them to methods on the models themselves. It captures the current user when a controller begins executing, and implicitly checks every method call to a protected method on a model. If a method is executed that the user does not have permission to call, than an exception will be thrown. Unfortunately, Stonewall is largely undocumented, and is totally untested and unmaintained.

\paragraph{Cancan.} Cancan allows developers to define rule-based permissions for CRUD operations in a single central Ability class. Cancan includes an declarative Ruby DSL to define permissions: rules can range from statements that grant a user permission to perform all actions on all models, to declaring that the current user can only view a specific model that they are associated with through a deeply-nested relationship. Cancan defines a \verb!can?! predicate that tests whether the current user can perform an action on a specified target, and an \verb|authorize!| method that raises an exception if an action canâ€™t be performed on a specified target.

In addition to basic permission-checking methods, Cancan includes tools to remove boilerplate permission checks, and to protect against holes due to forgotten permission checks. Any controller class may be configured to automatically load, create, or list objects before passing control to the standard RESTful actions. Controllers may also be flagged with \verb!check_authorization! to raise an exception if no permission check is performed while handling a controller action. Unfortunately, resource autoloading and auto-authorization conflicts with the new protections against mass assignment attacks introduced in Rails 4. The latest Rails version that is compatible with Cancan is version 3.2.15.

\paragraph{Authority.} Authority is an authorization library for Rails 4 that takes a somewhat different approach than Cancan. Developers define one class, called an authorizer, for each model to authorize. Each authorizer consists of a series of methods, such as \verb!creatable_by?!, which return a boolean indicating whether the current user can perform the action corresponding to the method. Like Cancan, Authority provides a method to enforce permissions and raise an exception if they are not fulfilled, another to query if a user is permitted to perform an action, and a way to ensure that authorization is performed in each action of a controller. Authority requires more setup and wiring than Cancan; for example, to define an authorizer method for a custom action, one must first add the action to a configuration file so that Authority knows which authorizer method to call to check permissions on the action. Additionally, Authority lacks Cancanâ€™s ability to automatically load and authorize models.

\paragraph{Pundit.} Like Authority, Pundit is an authorization library for Rails 4 that represents access rules with one authorization class per model. Each corresponding class (called a policy) has one boolean method for each action that may be taken on the model. Similarly to Cancan and Authority, Pundit defines one controller method to enforce permissions, another to query permissions on objects, and a third to ensure that authorization is performed in each action. As is the case with Authority, Pundit canâ€™t automatically load and authorize models. However, unlike Authority, Pundit eschews configuration files for method naming conventions, and requires no setup beyond installing the gem.

\par \noindent \\ After reviewing the documentation and open issues for each library, Pundit was selected as the authorization system for the case study. Stonewall was eliminated for being too unwieldy, as per-method and per-attribute access control are much more granular than necessary, and much harder to validate than per-action access control. Cancan was eliminated due to its incompatibility with Rails 4, and because it doesnâ€™t appear to be actively maintained. Pundit was chosen over Authority as it provides the same feature set as Authority with less configuration and boilerplate. Pundit is actively maintained, and is seeing an increase in use as developers migrate away from Cancan. Though Pundit lacks support for automatically loading and authorizing objects, we can achieve the same thing ourselves by using a library like \verb!inherited_resources! and overloading the relevant controller methods perform do authorization automatically.

An example pundit policy is given in Figure \ref{fig:4ys-pundit-policy}. This policy allows all users to view projects, but only allows coordinators and the supervisors assigned to a project to update or delete them. This policy is automatically associated with \verb!Project! models, so we only need to call
\verb!authority @project! in each action in the the \verb!ProjectsController! to check it. Additionally, we can check permissions to conditionally show links and sections in the view by getting an instance of the policy and calling appropriate methods on it, such as \verb!policy(@project).destroy?!.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \begin{lstlisting}
class ProjectPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
  def show?
    true
  end

  def create?
    @user.is_supervisor?
  end

  def update?
    @user.is_coordinator? || user_supervises_project?
  end

  alias_method :destroy?, :update?

  def user_supervises_project?
    @user.is_supervisor? && @record.supervisors.include?(@user)
  end
end
  \end{lstlisting}

\sectionnote {BM}
\subsection {Presenting Available Actions}

Using AASM, we can extract information about all of the permitted event transitions from the current state of an object. Additionally, Pundit allows us to query which controller actions may be taken for the current user. As the system follows the convention that every event corresponds to a controller action, this information can be used to automatically present users with the actions they can perform for a task's current state, without resorting to hard-coding \verb!if! statements for role or state checks.

This functionality was implemented as a simple controller concern. In order to use it, controllers may include \verb!StateActionRenderable! and call 
\verb!render_state_actions! in the associated view, passing it a taskable. When it is called, the helper performs the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item First, it queries AASM for the events that cause transitions from the current state of the taskable.
\item Next, it checks the Pundit policy for the taskable to determine which of the events may be triggered by the current user. By convention, the method named \verb!<event>?!, ex. \verb!submit?! is used to check permissions for the event.
\item Finally, it renders the partial view with the same name as each permitted event.
\end{enumerate}

Of course, it may be the case that multiple controllers should share the same views. Controllers may override the method \verb!action_view_prefix!, which takes the event name as an argument and returns the view directory to look in to find the event partial. This is convenient, as it allows view delegation to be performed without having to create one partial per controller for each event, which would in turn only render another partial.

Though this functionality is useful for structuring actions, it comes with an associated cost in user interface flexibility. As the partials for each action are separate, there is no way to have them share user interface elements, which leads to some redundancy. It is possible to alter the state machine so that elements which be rendered together use the same event, and check a guard to determine which transition to take; however, it is undesirable to compromise the model in order to improve the user interface. \todo {Create an illustration to support this assertion, and demonstrate the difference between the original mockups and the user interfaces produced with this technique.}
