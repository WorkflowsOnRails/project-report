\chapter{The Engineering Project}

\sectionnote {AC}
\section{Health and Safety}

This project defines a workflow devlopment platform for creating web applications using Ruby on Rails. Because of the nature of this project there are no health and safety concerns.

\section{Engineering Professionalism}

TODO: what are we supposed to even talk about here!?!?!?

Using their course experience of ECOR 4995 Professional Practice, students should demonstrate how their professional responsibilities were met by the goals of their project and/or during the performance of their project.

\section{Project Management}

TODO: How we scheduled what to work on and due dates

We used the version control system git and github to manage all the code for this project. We made separate repositories for each library we created allowing us to keep our case studies and our libraries separate. This setup allows each library to be individually  maintained separately from the case studies which use them.

\section{Individual Contributions}

This section will go over the contributions of each member describing what they worked on during each stage of the project.

\subsection{Project Contributions}

The first part of our project was to test existing workflow web application frameworks. Brendan researched the Stonepath framework and Alexander researched the Ruote framework. We both then created and designed simple issue trackers using the frameworks we researched to see how useful they actually were.

For the first case study Brendan worked on the state machine design and implementation while Alexander worked on account management and project selection. Detailed use cases were created by each member for what they worked on. The testing of the state machines was done by Brendan and the integration testing of the system as a whole was done by Alexander.

In the second case study the roles were switched. Alexander designed and implemented the state machines while Brendan worked on the account management and project selection. Just like in the first case study, detailed use cases were created by each member for what they worked on. Alexander did the state machine testing and integration testing for the second case study.

The final part of our project was the definition of existing libraries and the extraction of useful functionallity to define our platform. Brendan researched and found all of the libraries we used to contstruct our case studies and also extracted the common functionality of the case studies into their own libraries. Alexander used these libraries using only the documentation in order to ensure they were easy to understand and learn for a new developer.
